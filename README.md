Web Scraping and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with FAISS
📌 Overview
This project combines web scraping and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using LangChain, FAISS, and Groq's Gemma-2 9B model. The application scrapes web content, processes it into vector embeddings, and enables users to ask questions about the scraped content.

🚀 Features
Web Scraping: Extracts text from a given URL using requests and BeautifulSoup.
Text Chunking: Splits the extracted text into smaller segments using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
Vector Storage & Retrieval: Uses FAISS to store and retrieve similar text chunks.
LLM-Powered Q&A: Utilizes Groq’s Gemma-2 9B IT model to answer questions based on retrieved context.
Conversational AI: Generates human-like, engaging responses with emojis and expressions for better UX.
